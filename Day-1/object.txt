Objects and its internal representation in Javascript
-------------------------------------------------------

Objects are the building blocks in javascript. 

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. 

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

Objects are unordered collections of data and they are in the form of "key:value" pair.  

The key:value pair (in JavaScript objects) are called properties. 

Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only. An object method is an object property containing a 
function definition.
