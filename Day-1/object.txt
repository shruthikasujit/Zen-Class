Objects and its internal representation in Javascript
-------------------------------------------------------

Objects are the building blocks in javascript. 

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. 

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

Objects are unordered collections of data and they are in the form of "key:value" pair.  

The internal representation of objects in JavaScript varies depending on the JavaScript engine or runtime environment being used.   

Object Properties
------------------

A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.

The key:value pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties. 

Object properties are as same as variable except for the attachment to objects.

Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only. An object method is an object property containing a 
function definition.

Object Methods
--------------
JavaScript methods are functions associated  with the object.

A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

Prototype
---------
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

When a property is accessed on an object, the JavaScript engine will look for it in the object's prototype.

Creation of object
------------------

The internal representation of objects created through different methods can vary, but the resulting objects will have similar 
properties and behavior.
