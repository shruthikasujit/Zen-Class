HTTP 1.1:
 1. The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. The first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
 2. HTTP/1.1 is much slower than HTTP/2.
 3. It works on the textual format.
 4. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
 5. It compresses data by itself.

HTTP 2:
 1. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
 2. HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
 3. It works on the binary protocol.
 4. HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other 
 resource.
 5. It uses HPACK for data compression.
